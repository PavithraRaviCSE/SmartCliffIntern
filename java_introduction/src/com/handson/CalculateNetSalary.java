/*Write a Java program to calculate Net Salary. User must input
Basic Salary and Output should be net salary calculated based on
following allowances:
Allowances:
DA = 70% of Basic Salary
HRA = 7% of Basic Salary
MA = 2% of Basic Salary
TA = 4% of Basic Salary
Deduction:
PF = 12% of Basic Salary
Income/professional tax = User Input (e.g., 500)
Net Salary = Basic Salary + Allowances â€“ Deduction*/
